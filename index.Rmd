# Overview

This document quantifies the number of income and geographic qualified population in each state Solstice operates in. Utiliy zones are overlaid with these populations to estimate the potential population Solstice would be competing to sign up.The goal of this work is to quantify the potential market for LMI population for future Solstice bidding opportunities. 

Utility coverage is provided by either the [HIFLD](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f4cd55044b924fed9bc8b64022966097/explore?location=41.065293%2C-80.583661%2C6.90) national level electric retail service territories or, preferably, state sources that are more granular. Note HIFLD often provides overlapping areas (ex: a municipal boundary and an utility provider) so data should primarily be sourced from state sources or be validated from HIFLD. 

Please refer to the [policy matrix](https://coda.io/d/Solstice-Policy_dBUL-zOSfnb/Program-Matrix_suVJB#Program-Matrix_tuLIr/r11&view=full) on Coda for further details on state specific LMI and geoqualification methods.
